# Human-Action-Detection
Human Action Detection Project Developed a deep learning model to detect and classify human actions in real-time video streams. Utilized CNN and LSTM architectures for feature extraction and sequence learning, improving accuracy and performance. Applied in surveillance, healthcare monitoring, and smart security systems.

# Human Action Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
Human Action Detection is a computer vision project that identifies and classifies human actions in real-time using deep learning techniques. The model processes video input or image sequences to detect and label various human activities. This system is useful for surveillance, healthcare monitoring, sports analytics, and human-computer interaction.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects and classifies human actions from video or live camera feed.
- Uses deep learning for high accuracy and real-time processing.
- Can be applied to multiple domains like security, healthcare, and sports.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** for video processing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** for visualization

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is **mhealth_raw.csv**, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:

- **Kaggle Dataset:** [MHEALTH Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com)
- **Features:** Data collected from motion sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.
- **Target:** Type of physical activity (e.g., walking, running, sitting, standing).

## ⚙️ Installation
